# Database-Development-

This project is a basic idealogy of the implementation of capturing the details and making sure to store those details and making them visible in the SQL Database as well. This is a combination of multiple softwares such as using Eclipse as a platform for the creation of dialog box, java as the programming language for the development of the Usser Interface and establishing a connection between the UI and the database. We even establish a connection between the Database and the UI which helps us in understanding more about the topic. We make use of queries for the display of the data in the database by using the basic SQL Queries. Thus, in this way we can create a basic User Interface for the development and usage of the same and also get an idea regarding the software addn also programming languages Java and MySQL.
